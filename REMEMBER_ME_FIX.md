# Remember Me Fix - Session Management

## Problem
The "Remember Me" checkbox on the login page was not working properly. Regardless of whether it was checked or not, all sessions lasted for 30 days.

## Root Cause
The session configuration in `server/auth.ts` had a default `maxAge` of 30 days set for ALL sessions:

```typescript
cookie: {
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 30 days - ALWAYS applied
}
```

When the login route tried to override this by setting `maxAge` to `undefined` for unchecked "Remember Me", it didn't work as expected because the default was already set.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Session Configuration
Removed the default `maxAge` and added proper security settings:

```typescript
cookie: {
  // Don't set default maxAge - let login route handle it based on rememberMe
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',  // HTTPS only in production
  httpOnly: true,                                  // Prevent XSS attacks
  sameSite: 'lax',                                 // CSRF protection
}
```

### 2. Improved Login Route Logic
Changed from setting `undefined` to using `delete`:

```typescript
app.post("/api/login", passport.authenticate("local"), (req, res) => {
  const rememberMe = req.body.rememberMe === true;
  
  if (req.session) {
    if (rememberMe) {
      // Set cookie to expire in 30 days if remember me is checked
      req.session.cookie.maxAge = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 30 days
    } else {
      // Set cookie to expire when browser closes (session cookie)
      delete req.session.cookie.maxAge;
    }
  }
  
  res.status(200).json(req.user);
});
```

## How It Works Now

### When "Remember Me" is CHECKED ✅
1. User checks the "Remember Me" checkbox
2. Frontend sends `rememberMe: true` to `/api/login`
3. Backend sets `cookie.maxAge = 30 days`
4. Session cookie will persist for 30 days
5. User stays logged in even after closing browser

### When "Remember Me" is UNCHECKED ❌
1. User leaves "Remember Me" unchecked
2. Frontend sends `rememberMe: false` (or omits it)
3. Backend deletes `cookie.maxAge`
4. Session cookie has NO expiration date
5. Cookie is a **session cookie** (expires when browser closes)
6. User will need to login again after closing browser

## How to Test

### Test 1: Remember Me CHECKED
1. **Clear browser cookies** and go to login page
2. Enter credentials: `taha@qadi.ps` / `Admin@Qadi2025`
3. **CHECK** the "Remember Me" checkbox
4. Click "Login"
5. **Close the browser completely**
6. **Open browser again** and go to the app
7. ✅ **Expected**: You should still be logged in

### Test 2: Remember Me UNCHECKED
1. **Logout** and go to login page
2. Enter credentials: `taha@qadi.ps` / `Admin@Qadi2025`
3. **DO NOT CHECK** the "Remember Me" checkbox
4. Click "Login"
5. **Close the browser completely**
6. **Open browser again** and go to the app
7. ✅ **Expected**: You should see the login page (logged out)

### Test 3: Verify Cookie Settings (Developer Tools)
1. Login with Remember Me checked
2. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
3. Find the `connect.sid` cookie
4. ✅ **Expected**: Expiration date set to ~30 days from now

5. Logout and login WITHOUT Remember Me
6. Check the cookie again
7. ✅ **Expected**: Expiration shows "Session" (no date)

## Security Improvements

### 1. HttpOnly Flag
```typescript
httpOnly: true
```
- Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie
- Protects against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks
- Cookie can only be read by the server

### 2. Secure Flag (Production)
```typescript
secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
```
- Cookie only sent over HTTPS in production
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Development uses HTTP, so secure is false

### 3. SameSite Protection
```typescript
sameSite: 'lax'
```
- Protects against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks
- Cookie only sent with same-site requests
- Allows some cross-site navigation (like following a link)

## Technical Details

### Session Cookie vs Persistent Cookie

**Session Cookie (Remember Me = OFF)**
- No `maxAge` property set
- Browser stores in memory only
- Deleted when browser closes
- More secure for shared computers

**Persistent Cookie (Remember Me = ON)**
- Has `maxAge` = 2,592,000,000 ms (30 days)
- Browser stores on disk
- Survives browser restarts
- Convenient for personal devices

### Cookie Attributes
```
Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A...;
  Path=/;
  Expires=Thu, 16 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT;  // Only if Remember Me checked
  HttpOnly;
  SameSite=Lax;
  Secure                                    // Only in production
```

## Files Modified
- ✅ `server/auth.ts` - Session configuration and login route
- ✅ `client/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Already had checkbox (no changes needed)

## Backward Compatibility
✅ This fix maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing active sessions continue to work
- Users will be prompted to login again when their current session expires
- New logins will use the new behavior
