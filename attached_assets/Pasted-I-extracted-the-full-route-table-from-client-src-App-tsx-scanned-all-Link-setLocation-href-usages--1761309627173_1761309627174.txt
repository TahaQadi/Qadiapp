I extracted the full route table from client/src/App.tsx, scanned all Link/setLocation/href usages, and reviewed headers for back buttons across key pages.

Report: wrong/illogical links and missing back buttons
Routes defined

Public: /landing, /login, /onboarding, /logout, /products/:subCategory/:productName, /catalog/:category, /catalog
Redirect/root: / redirects to /admin if admin else /ordering
Auth-protected: /ordering, /orders, /profile, /price-request, /price-offers
Admin: /admin, /admin/products, /admin/vendors, /admin/clients, /admin/price-management, /admin/price-requests, /admin/orders, /admin/order-modifications, /admin/issue-reports, /admin/feedback, /admin/error-logs, /admin/templates/documents, /admin/documents, /admin/ltas/:id, /admin/ltas, /admin/reports, /admin/demo-requests
Catch-all: NotFound
Wrong or illogical internal links

ClientPriceOffersPage header back link points to /:
Expected: For authenticated users, home redirects; but a more logical back target is /ordering (client area) or previous page. Current link may cause a flicker via root redirects.
Current: <Link href="/"> in header.
Suggested: <Link href="/ordering"> for signed-in clients; or use useLocation go back pattern.
CatalogPage header back link points to /:
Current: <Link href="/">
Suggested: If reached from ordering flow, back to /ordering feels more consistent. Alternatively keep to / if intentional as “home”; but note / immediately redirects and can be jarring.
ProductDetailPage header back link uses conditional:
Current: <Link href={user ? '/ordering' : '/'}>
Minor: For unauthenticated, / redirects to /landing. Consider linking directly to /landing for clarity. Breadcrumb also links /catalog labelled with product.mainCategory, which is acceptable but note /catalog/:category route also exists; linking to /catalog/${product.mainCategory} would be more specific.
AdminPriceRequestsPage: CTA link to /admin/price-offers
Route table has no /admin/price-offers. The only “price offers” page in routes is client-side /price-offers.
This link is likely broken. If an admin price offers management page is intended, add route and page; if not, change link or remove.
AdminPage dashboard links are all valid to declared routes.
Pages missing or inconsistent back buttons

Many admin pages correctly include back to /admin with an ArrowLeft:
AdminProductsPage, AdminVendorsPage, AdminReportsPage, AdminTemplatesPage, AdminOrdersPage, AdminLtaListPage, AdminLtaDetailPage, AdminDocumentsPage all have a back button to /admin. Good.
Client pages:
OrdersPage: back to /ordering present. Good.
ClientPriceOffersPage: back to / (see above). Recommend /ordering.
ClientProfilePage: no header back button. Consider adding back to /ordering for consistency with other client pages.
PriceRequestPage: back present to / (same consideration; suggest /ordering).
CatalogPage: back to / (see above).
ProductDetailPage: back present (conditional). Good.
OrderingPage, LandingPage, LoginPage, OnboardingPage: contexts where back may be optional; Onboarding has its own previous-step control and is fine.
External links and anchors

LandingPage contains external mailto:, tel:, and https://wa.me links. These are fine and not internal routes.
Recommendations
Fix broken admin link

In client/src/pages/AdminPriceRequestsPage.tsx, change:
From: <Link href="/admin/price-offers">
To one of:
If an admin offers index exists or will be added: add matching route and page (/admin/price-offers), or
If intent is to view client-facing offers, change to /price-offers but ensure this is appropriate for admins.
Normalize client back targets to avoid root redirect

ClientPriceOffersPage, CatalogPage, PriceRequestPage: change header back link target to /ordering.
ProductDetailPage: change unauthenticated back link from / to /landing, and breadcrumb “catalog” link from /catalog to /catalog/${product.mainCategory} when available.
Add missing back button

ClientProfilePage: add a header back button to /ordering for consistency.
