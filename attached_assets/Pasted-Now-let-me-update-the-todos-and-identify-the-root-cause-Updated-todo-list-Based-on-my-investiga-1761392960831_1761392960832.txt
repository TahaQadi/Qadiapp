Based on my investigation, I've identified the root causes of the app crash:

Root Cause Analysis
Issue 1: Replit Object Storage Connection Failure

The app is trying to connect to Replit's object storage service at 127.0.0.1:1106
This connection is being refused (ECONNREFUSED)
The @replit/object-storage client is initialized immediately when the module is imported (line 6 in object-storage.ts)
This happens during server startup, causing an unhandled promise rejection
Issue 2: Port Already in Use

The app is trying to use port 26053 which is already occupied
This suggests there might be another instance of the app running or a port conflict
Let me check what port the app is actually configured to use:

Searched and ran terminal command
Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The PORT environment variable is set to 26053, but there's already a process using that port. Let me check what's using it and create a comprehensive fix plan:

Root Cause Analysis Summary
I've identified two critical issues causing the app crash after pull request 8:

Issue 1: Replit Object Storage Connection Failure
Problem: The @replit/object-storage client is initialized immediately when the module is imported
Error: ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:1106 - Replit's object storage service is not available
Impact: Causes unhandled promise rejection during server startup
Location: server/object-storage.ts line 6: const client = new Client();
Issue 2: Port Already in Use
Problem: PORT environment variable is set to 26053, but that port is already occupied
Error: EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:26053
Impact: Server cannot start because the port is unavailable
Fix Plan
Updated todo list
Comprehensive Fix Plan
1. Fix Replit Object Storage Connection Issue
Problem: The object storage client is initialized immediately, causing connection failures when Replit services aren't available.

Solution: Implement lazy initialization and proper error handling:

Move client initialization to a lazy getter function
Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff
Gracefully handle connection failures without crashing the app
Add fallback behavior when object storage is unavailable
2. Fix Port Conflict Issue
Problem: Port 26053 is already in use, preventing the server from starting.

Solution:

Kill any existing processes using port 26053
Implement port fallback logic
Add better error handling for port conflicts
