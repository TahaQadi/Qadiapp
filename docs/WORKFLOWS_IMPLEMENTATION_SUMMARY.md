- **Testing**: Vitest

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Run "Quality - Full Check" before commits
- Use "DB - Backup" before migrations
- Clear cache after major dependency updates
- Check error logs weekly
- Use Pre-Deploy Check before production deployments

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't skip pre-deployment checks
- Don't modify read-only workflows (create new ones)
- Don't run "DB - Reset & Seed" on production data
- Don't ignore error log patterns
- Don't deploy without running tests

---

## üîí Security & Safety

### Safe Operations
- All workflows run in your development environment
- No external API calls or data transmission
- Commands are visible and auditable
- Workflows can be stopped at any time

### Potentially Dangerous Operations
- **DB - Reset & Seed**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deletes all database data
- **Maint - Clear Cache**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires rebuild after execution
- **DB - Backup**: Requires sufficient disk space

### Recommendations
1. Always backup before destructive operations
2. Review workflow commands before execution
3. Test workflows in development first
4. Keep production backups external to Repl

---

## üìà Performance Impact

### Build Times
- **Before**: Manual command entry (~15-30 seconds)
- **After**: One-click execution (~5 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: 66-83% reduction in task initiation

### Developer Experience
- Reduced context switching
- Standardized team processes
- Faster onboarding for new developers
- Consistent quality checks
