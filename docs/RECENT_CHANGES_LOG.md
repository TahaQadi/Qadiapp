## January 21, 2025 - Price Request/Offer Linking Fix

### Issue
Price requests and price offers were not properly linked, making it difficult to track which offers were created from which requests.

### Changes Made

#### 1. AdminPriceRequestsPage.tsx
- **Removed**: Next.js `Link` import (not available in React Router setup)
- **Fixed**: "Create Offer" button now uses direct navigation via `window.location.href`
- **Added**: Visual indicator (badge) showing when a request has been processed
- **Added**: Button state management - button is disabled after offer is created
- **Updated**: UI to show "Already Created" text when request status is 'processed'
- **Removed**: Duplicate offer creation dialog - simplified to direct navigation

#### 2. Server Routes (routes.ts)
- **Confirmed**: `requestId` field exists in `price_offers` table schema
- **Confirmed**: Offer creation endpoint accepts `requestId` parameter
- **Confirmed**: Request status is updated to 'processed' when offer is created

#### 3. Database Schema
```typescript
priceOffers: {
  requestId: varchar("request_id").references(() => priceRequests.id, { onDelete: "set null" })
  // This allows linking offers back to their originating requests
}
```

### Technical Details

**Navigation Flow**:
1. Admin clicks "Create Offer" on a pending price request
2. Page navigates to `/admin/price-offers/create?requestId={request.id}`
3. Offer creation page pre-fills data from the request
4. When offer is saved, `requestId` is included in the POST request
5. Server updates request status to 'processed'
6. UI reflects the change immediately

**Status Management**:
- Request status: `pending` ‚Üí `processed` (when offer is created)
- Offer status: `draft` ‚Üí `sent` ‚Üí `viewed` ‚Üí `accepted/rejected`

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Price request creation works
- ‚úÖ "Create Offer" button navigates correctly
- ‚úÖ Request status updates to 'processed'
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback shows when request is processed
- ‚úÖ Button is disabled after offer creation

### Files Modified

### Price Management System Improvements

#### 1. Fixed Currency Display Issue in Order History
**File:** `client/src/pages/OrderingPage.tsx`

**Impact:**
- Order cards now show accurate total item count
- Better reflects actual order size
