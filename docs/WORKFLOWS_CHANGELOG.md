## Performance Metrics

### Estimated Execution Times

| Workflow | Average Duration | Max Duration | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Test - Run All | 30-45s | 60s | Depends on test count |
| DB - Migrate | 5-10s | 15s | Varies with schema complexity |
| Quality - Full Check | 40-60s | 90s | Combined type check + tests |

### Resource Usage

- **CPU**: Moderate during test execution, low otherwise
- **Memory**: ~200-400MB per workflow
- **Network**: Minimal (only for dependency resolution if needed)
- **Disk I/O**: Low (mainly reading test/source files)

---

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**No action required!** New workflows are immediately available:
- Access via Tools sidebar → Workflows
- Access via Command palette (`Cmd+K` → "workflows")
- Access via workflow dropdown menu

### For CI/CD Integration

To integrate workflows into automated pipelines:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run check && npm test

# Run database migrations
npm run db:push

# Full validation pipeline
npm run check && npm test && npm run db:push
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Workflow Execution
- ✅ All workflows run in user's development environment
- ✅ No external API calls required
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in logs
- ✅ Commands are visible and auditable

### Database Migrations
- ⚠️ Requires appropriate database permissions
- ⚠️ Always backup data before running migrations
- ✅ Migrations are reversible (manual rollback available)

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Workflows Cause Issues

1. **Disable Individual Workflow**
   - Edit `.replit` file
   - Remove problematic workflow configuration
   - Restart Repl

2. **Revert All Changes**
   - Restore previous `.replit` from version control
   - Restart Repl

3. **Fallback to Manual Commands**
   - All workflows can be run manually in terminal
   - Example: `npm test`, `npm run check`, etc.
