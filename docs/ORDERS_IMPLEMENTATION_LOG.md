### YYYY-MM-DD

**Phase**: Phase 1: Critical Fixes  
**Task**: 1.1 Order Confirmation Step  
**Developer**: System Analysis  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

**Work Performed**:
1. Created `OrderConfirmationDialog.tsx` component
   - Displays full order summary before submission
   - Shows LTA contract information
   - Lists all items with quantities and prices
   - Calculates subtotal, tax (15%), and total
   - Provides "Edit Order" and "Confirm Order" actions
   - Includes warning notice about order processing
   - Fully bilingual (English/Arabic) with RTL support

2. Updated `OrderingPage.tsx`
   - Added order confirmation dialog state
   - Modified `handleSubmitOrder` to show confirmation instead of direct submission
   - Created new `handleConfirmOrder` callback for actual order submission
   - Integrated confirmation dialog into component tree
   - Passes cart items and LTA information to confirmation dialog

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/components/OrderConfirmationDialog.tsx` (new)
- `client/src/pages/OrderingPage.tsx`

**Success Criteria Met**:
- User sees confirmation before order is placed
- Can review all details before confirming
- Can cancel and return to cart
- Mobile-friendly dialog with responsive layout
- Shows LTA contract information
- Displays tax calculation
- Loading state during submission

**Testing Notes**:
- Dialog opens when "Submit Order" is clicked from cart
- "Edit Order" button closes confirmation and reopens cart
- "Confirm Order" button submits the order
- Proper validation for single LTA enforcement
- Bilingual content displays correctly

## Questions & Decisions

### Open Questions
1. Which email service provider should we use? (SendGrid vs AWS SES vs Postmark)
2. Do we need real-time order updates or polling is sufficient?
3. Should we implement websockets for live notifications?

### Decisions Made
1. **2025-01-19**: Decided to prioritize critical fixes before new features
2. **2025-01-19**: Service layer refactoring will happen in Phase 3, not Phase 1
3. **2025-01-19**: Mobile-first approach for all new components
