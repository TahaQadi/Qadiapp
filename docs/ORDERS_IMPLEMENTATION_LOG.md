2. Do we need real-time order updates or polling is sufficient?
3. Should we implement websockets for live notifications?

### Decisions Made
1. **2025-01-19**: Decided to prioritize critical fixes before new features
2. **2025-01-19**: Service layer refactoring will happen in Phase 3, not Phase 1
3. **2025-01-19**: Mobile-first approach for all new components
